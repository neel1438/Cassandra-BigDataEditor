Main Goals of our Project :

● Create a web application that interacts with Cassandra (Database server)
● Web Base, so can access using any browser.
● Managing and monitoring backend system(cassandra nodes) very easily.
● Help user insert into database without knowing anything about cassandra query language.
● It should be easy for user( with less cassandra knowledge ) to use our application
